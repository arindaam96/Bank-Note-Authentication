# Bank-Note-Authentication

**Goal of the Project --->**
          Building a model to predict the authecity of the Notes submitted in Bank
          
          
**Data Collection --->**

          Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection           was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi             were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

**Data preprocessing --->**

          cheked the Missing Values
          attributed the Dependent and Independent Variables 
          Splitted the Data into Train & Test Dataset
          
    
**Model Building --->**

          Algorithm Used = **Random Forest**
          Classifier used = **RandomForestClassifier**
          found out the accurancy using **SkLearn**
          
   
**Visualization --->**

          Used ****Seaborn**** to plot the Predicted values against the Actual Values to get a better understanding of the model accuracy.
